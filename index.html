<h1><em>OGWO SOUP RECIPE</em>  </h1>
<p>Ogwo evwri soup is a soup eaten in the South-Cental region of Nigeria. It is common among the Urhobo's, Isoko's and Itsekiri's.
    <br>
    It is traditionally served at weddings in Delta State; its absence at a wedding celebration is considered an insult to guests. It is also
    <br>
     served at other traditional celebrations.

    <h4><i>Cooking Methods</i></h4>
    <!--instructions-->
    <section>
        <ol>
            <li>Boil and season your meat. Once they have <u>sufficiently</u> cooked with some stock left, add your blended tomatoes, pepper
                <br> and your seasoning cube.</li>
            <li>Add the crayfish and smoked fish.</li>
            <li>Bring the contents of the pot to a gentle simmer for about 10 mins.</li>
            <li>Then add some of the soup on heat into the cold water soaked garri to loosen it into a very watery mixture, then add the 
                <br> watery garri mix back into the soup on heat.
            </li>
            <li>Stir and allow to boil for 10-15 mins. Taste and adjust seasoning as needed.</li>
            <li>The soup should gradually start to thicken at this point. Keep stirring intermittently for 5-10 mins.</li>
            <li>Dissolve potash about the size of half - 3 quarters of a knor cube in about 6 Tbsp of water and add to the pot and bring to boil. The <br>presence
                of the tomatoes, will mean it wouldn't bubble up as much.</li>
                <li>Leave it to cook and in a few minutes, you will notice that the addition of the potash has caused the prior watery stock to thicken
                    <br> a little. Take it off the heat and let it cool down a little.
                </li>
                <li>Stir in Palm oil into the pot. The soup will thicken and the colour will change to a pale shade of yellowish orange.</li>
                <li>Allow to cook for about 10 mins (or until the consistency is what you want), stir intermittently so it doesn't burn.</li>
                <li>Served with Usi(starch), green plantain(boiled or grilled), eba(garri) or any other swallow.</li>
        </ol>

<h4><b><i><mark>Notes:</mark></i></b></h4>
<!--added info-->
<ul>
    <li>If using a fish that easily scatter, add it to the potash same as if using a fresh fish.</li>
    <li>Make sure the potash is grind smooth and there are no big pieces. Mix with water, allow to sit for about 5 mins and sieve. Only use the 
        <br>drained part.</li>
    <li>Filter the garri with a sieve, only use the very smooth part, the part you sieved out, and discard the grainy/shaft part.</li>
</ul>
